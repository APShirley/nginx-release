      This is the chained SSL certificate for the website; This is in PEM
      format.  The topmost certificate should be the certificate for the
      website itself.  (e.g. in the case of sslip.io, the certificate for
      sslip.io). The second-from-top certificate should be the intermediate
      certificate (e.g.  "COMODO RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA"). If
      there is another intermediate certificate, that should follow (e.g.
      "COMODO RSA Certification Authority").  There is no reason to include the
      root certificate, but there is no harm in including it either. It should
      be the last certificate (bottom-most).
